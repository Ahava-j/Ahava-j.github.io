  "AboutText":"Hello, I am a third-year Computer Science student with a minor in Communications at Seattle Pacific University. My interests extend to utilizing technology in addressing critical societal issues. I am particularly passionate about leveraging technology for anti-trafficking initiatives and forensic science applications. Currently, I am actively seeking a summer 2024 internship related to anti-trafficking technology solutions. I am excited about the potential to contribute meaningful projects and make a positive impact. If you have insights, job opportunities, or wish to connect and discuss how we can have influence through technology, please feel free to contact me."
